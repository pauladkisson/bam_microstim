# bam_microstim
Adding microstimulation to the Wang 2002 Biophysical Attractor Model of decision-making

## Description of Project Organization
The project is generally run by 4 code scripts:
  1) bam_constants.m defines all the necessary constants, generates connectivities/neuron locations/stimulation conditions for a given simulation.
  2) main.m runs the main simulation program, which simulates leaky-integrate-and-fire dynamics, synaptic currents, task-related currents, background currents, and microstimulation currents for a variety of task conditions (coherences) and microstimulation inputs.  Spike times for each neuron are stored in a containers.map variable called ``recspikes`` in .mat files.
  3) analyze_main.m runs analysis of the raw spike time data to generate data of interest such as accuracy and decision time, and stores them in "decisions.mat" files.
  4)  plot_results.m plots the data generated by analyze_main.m, in a variety of visualizations. each of which calls various functions.

The data is stored in a different folder for each simulation ("Simulation X"), which is determined by the ``sim_name`` variable defined in bam_constants.m.
