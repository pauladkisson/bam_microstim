# bam_microstim
Adding microstimulation to the Wang 2002 Biophysical Attractor Model of decision-making

## Description of Project Organization
The project is generally run by 4 code scripts:
  1) bam_constants.m defines all the necessary constants, generates connectivities/neuron locations/stimulation conditions for a given simulation.
  2) main.m runs the main simulation program, which simulates leaky-integrate-and-fire dynamics, synaptic currents, task-related currents, background currents, and microstimulation currents for a variety of task conditions (coherences) and microstimulation inputs.  Spike times for each neuron are stored in a containers.map variable called ``recspikes`` in .mat files.
  3) analyze_main.m runs analysis of the raw spike time data to generate data of interest such as accuracy and decision time, and stores them in "decisions.mat" files.
  4)  plot_results.m plots the data generated by analyze_main.m, in a variety of visualizations. each of which calls various functions.

The data is stored in a different folder for each simulation ("Simulation X"), which is determined by the ``sim_name`` variable defined in bam_constants.m.    

## How to use
- Define name of simulation with ``sim_name`` variable in bam_constants.m (ex. "X")
- Adjust parameters as necessary
- Call bam_constants --> saves necessary constants
- Update ``sim_name`` in main.m
- Call main.m --> for each brain/stimulation condition/coherence/trial, saves data in "Simulation X/brainY/data/``stim_amp``nA_*stim_cond*/c=*coherence*/trialZ.mat"
- Update ``sim_name`` in analyze_main.m
- Set ``reconstruct = true`` to reconstruct instaneous population firing rates (``pop_frs``) from spike times (``recspikes``)
- Call analyze_main --> saves analyzed variables in "Simulation X/brainY/data/``stim_amp``nA*stim_cond*/decisions.mat"
- Update ``sim_name`` in plot_results.m
- Uncomment whichever plotting section you want to visualize
- Call plot_results --> visualizes data
